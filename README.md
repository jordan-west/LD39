##About

This is my entry for Ludum Dare 39 under the theme "Running out of power". It is my first time taking part, and I definitely ran out of time (see lack of audio and...well, levels). Despite being incomplete, I think this is a solid prototype that demonstrates what I was trying to achieve.

Power Down is a puzzle platformer where you are a blob with the ability to shoot out a beam from your antenna that is capable of powering down objects that it touches. You must traverse through the level solving puzzles such that you can reach the main power source at the end and disable the facility (note that only a tutorial level is implemented).

##Instructions

Use the A and D keys (or arrow keys) to move left and right, and use the spacebar to jump. Use the left mouse button to fire out a beam that disables objects that it touches. Note that you cannot fire your beam whilst in the air.
